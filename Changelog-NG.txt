Asuswrt-Merlin 386/NG Changelog
===============================

386.9-ion (xx-xxx-xxxx)
  - NOTE: 386_xx release are only for Wifi 5 (802.11ac) models.
  - NEW: Merged with GPL 386_50757.

  - UPDATED: getdns/stubby to 1.7.2/0.4.2.
  - UPDATED: zlib to 1.2.12 + backports.
  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1s.
  - UPDATED: inadyn to 2.10.0.
  - UPDATED: nettle to 3.8.1.
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.8.
  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2022.83.
  - CHANGED: Rebranded DNSFilter as DNS Director.  This will prevent
             confusion with the company sharing the same name, and
             also better describes what the feature does.
  - CHANGED: Setting an OpenVPN client to redirect all traffic while
             in "Exclusive" DNS mode will now force redirect ALL
             DNS traffic just like in VPN Director mode.
             While this will allow redirecting clients with
             hardcoded DNS servers, it also means that your whole
             LAN will lose the ability of doing local name
             resolution.  It might be best to use VPN Director
             in that case to control which client should
             be involved in the DNS redirection, or use
             DNSFilter instead of Exclusive DNS mode.
