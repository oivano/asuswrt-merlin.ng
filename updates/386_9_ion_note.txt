##  ion release asuswrt merlin changelog  ##

Date: January 20, 2023
Release: 386.9-ion

 - NOTE: 386_xx release are only for Wifi 5 (802.11ac) models.
 - NEW: Merged with GPL 386_50757.

  - UPDATED: getdns/stubby to 1.7.2/0.4.2.
  - UPDATED: zlib to 1.2.12 + backports.
  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1s.
  - UPDATED: inadyn to 2.10.0.
  - UPDATED: nettle to 3.8.1.
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.8.
  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2022.83.
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.88.
  - CHANGED: Rebranded DNSFilter as DNS Director.  This will prevent
             confusion with the company sharing the same name, and
             also better describes what the feature does.
  - CHANGED: Setting an OpenVPN client to redirect all traffic while
             in "Exclusive" DNS mode will now force redirect ALL
             DNS traffic just like in VPN Director mode.
             While this will allow redirecting clients with
             hardcoded DNS servers, it also means that your whole
             LAN will lose the ability of doing local name
             resolution.  It might be best to use VPN Director
             in that case to control which client should
             be involved in the DNS redirection, or use
             DNSFilter instead of Exclusive DNS mode.
             editing VPNDirector rules.
  - CHANGED: Switched generated self-signed certificate to an
             EC certificate.
  - CHANGED: Disabled DSS key support in Dropbear SSH.
  - FIXED: Wrong temperatures used by the temperature graphs
           (386.8 regression)
  - FIXED: Guest Network clients couldn't route through VPN
           (regression in 386.4 following a GPL merge).
  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 aren't
           redirected to the router's NTP if NTP interception is
           enabled.
  - FIXED: Name was truncated to 31 chars when enabling OpenVPN
           client's Server Certificate Name Validation.
  - FIXED: CVE-2022-37434 in zlib.
  - REMOVED: Interface selector on Speedtest page (no longer
             working, possibly due to an ookla client update)
