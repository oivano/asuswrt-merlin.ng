##  ion Asus Merlin changelog  ##

Date: April 16, 2024
Release: 386.13-ion

  - NOTE: all the models supported by Asuswrt-Merlin on the
          386_xx series are now officialy on Asus' End of Life
          list, which means unless there are new major security
          issues, no new updates will be provided by Asus.

          ion will tentatively attempt to continue to
          provide updates and fixes
  - ADDED:   mtr 0.95
  - ADDED:   htop 3.2.2
  - ADDED:   openconnect 9.12
  - ADDED:   webui add IPsec client support
  - UPDATED: strongSwan to 5.9.12
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.6.10.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.3.6.
  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.7.16.
  - UPDATED: OUI database used by networkmap and the webui.
  - CHANGED: QOS/Classification page can now resolve local IPv6
             addresses.
  - CHANGED: Display tracked connections on the QoS/Classification
             page even if QoS isn't set to Adaptive QoS.
  - CHANGED: Prevent the use of Apple's iCloud Private Relay
             when enabling "Prevent client auto DoH".
  - CHANGED: NAT Passthrough page - removed the "Enabled + NAT
             Helper" option as the firewall no longer blocks
             traffic when set to disabled.  This is back to the
             former behaviour, where this setting only controls
             whether or not to load the NAT helper.  You might
             need to readjust that setting if you had previously
             changed it.
  - CHANGED: SIP, RTSP and H323 ALG (NAT helpers) are now
             disabled by default, as these legacy features tend
             to create issues with modern VoIP setups.
             This change will only apply to people doing a
             factory default reset of their router.
  - FIXED: CVE-2023-48795 in dropbear.
  - FIXED: Various issues with the QOS Classification page.
  - FIXED: UPNP leases without a description would not appear
           on the Forwarded Ports page.
  - FIXED: web server crashing when entering certain settings on
           the Network Filter Page.  Bypassed bug in closed source
           validation code for now.
  - FIXED: Concurrent cronjob changes through cru could cause
           collisions, leading to missing jobs (dave14305)
  - FIXED: CVE-2023-5678 & CVE-2024-0727 in openssl (backport from
           Ubuntu by RSDNTWK)
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.90 (resolves CVE 2023-50868 and CVE 2023-50387).
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.6.8 (fixes a crash introduced in 2.6.7)

           components)
