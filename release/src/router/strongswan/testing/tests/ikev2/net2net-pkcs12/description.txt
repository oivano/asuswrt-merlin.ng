A connection between the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> is set up.
The authentication is based on an RSA private key, a matching X.509 end entity
certificate and the issuing X.509 root CA certificate, all stored in a <b>PKCS12</b>
container.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, the updown script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, client <b>alice</b> behind gateway <b>moon</b>
pings client <b>bob</b> located behind gateway <b>sun</b>.
