<h1>Pulse Connect Secure</h1>

<p>Support for Pulse Connect Secure was added to OpenConnect in June 2019,
for the 8.04 release. It has also been known as Junos Pulse and Ivanti Pulse Connect
Secure, as its corporate ownership has changed.</p>

<p>In most cases, Pulse servers also support the older
<a href="juniper.html">Juniper Network Connect protocol</a>. The Pulse
and Juniper protocols are extremely different from each other, and both extremely
convoluted; the clearest improvement in the Pulse protocol is that it supports IPv6.</p>

<p>Pulse mode is requested by adding <tt>--protocol=pulse</tt>
to the command line:
<pre>
  openconnect --protocol=pulse vpn.example.com
</pre></p>

<p>The TCP transport for Pulse Connect Secure works over
<a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tnc-if-t-binding-to-tls/">IF-T/TLS</a>,
first using EAP (and EAP-TTLS if certificates are being used) for
authentication and then passing traffic over IF-T messages over
the same transport. Just as with the older Juniper protocol, the UDP
transport is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3948">ESP</a>.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>The authentication cookies are compatible with the
<a href="juniper.html">Juniper</a> mode, which means that external
tools like <a href="https://github.com/russdill/juniper-vpn-py">juniper-vpn-py</a>
should be usable with OpenConnect in Pulse mode too.</p>

<h3>Host Checker</h3>

<p>Support for Host Checker, also known as TNCC, has not yet been investigated and
implemented for Pulse mode. The Juniper support may suffice for some users.</p>

<h2>Connectivity</h2>

<p>Once authentication is complete, the VPN connection can be
established. Both Legacy IP and IPv6 should be working. Many
Pulse VPNs will not provide full IPv6 connectivity unless a recent
version of the official Pulse client for Windows is spoofed (see
<a href="https://gitlab.com/openconnect/openconnect/-/issues/254#note_661398964">comment
on GitLab issue #254</a>. Recent versions of OpenConnect will
do this automatically, but for older versions it will need to be
specified manually. For example:</p>

<pre>
  ./openconnect --protocol=pulse --useragent "Pulse-Secure/22.2.1.1295" --os=win
</pre>

<h2>Quirks and Issues</h2>

<p>Some Pulse VPNs may <i>request</i> a client certificate but not actually
<i>require</i> one. If you are trying to authenticate to such a VPN, and running
into strange errors about unrecognized packet types, then mimicking a <i>very old</i>
version of the official Pulse client software may help resolve the issue:</p>

<pre>
  ./openconnect --protocol=pulse --useragent "Pulse-Secure/3.0.0.0"
</pre>
