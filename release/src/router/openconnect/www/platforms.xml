	<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

<p>OpenConnect is known to work, with both IPv6 and Legacy IP, on Linux
(<a href="https://github.com/cernekee/ics-openconnect">including
Android</a>), OpenBSD, FreeBSD (including Debian GNU/kFreeBSD), NetBSD,
DragonFly BSD, OpenIndiana/OpenSolaris, Solaris 10/11, Windows and
Mac OS X platforms, and should be trivially portable to any other platform
supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a> devices
and on which <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/">GnuTLS</a> or
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> runs.</p>

<p>Although OpenConnect's <a href="vpnc-script.html">vpnc-script</a> was
originally based on that of vpnc, you <b>should not</b> use that one; it hasn't
been officially updated since 2008. Please use the updated script from the <a
href="https://gitlab.com/openconnect/vpnc-scripts">vpnc-scripts</a>
repository instead. That repository also contains an updated version of
<tt>vpnc-script-win.js</tt> for Windows.</p>

<p>
OpenConnect is known to work on at least i386, x86_64, PowerPC, MIPS, and ARM
processors, and should not have issues with portability to other CPUs.</p>

<p>Note that 'Cisco Secure Desktop' support may require the ability to run Linux/i386 binaries;
see the <a href="csd.html">CSD page</a>. OpenConnect does not yet support
CSD under Windows, but this is a <a href="contribute.html">much-desired
contribution</a>.</p>

<h2>New Ports</h2>
<p>
Platform support for new UNIX systems is relatively simple to add
&#8212; most of the difference is in the TUN/TAP device handling, and
the major variants of that are already supported.</p>
<p>
OpenConnect builds for Windows using MinGW in 32-bit and 64-bit mode, and
works with the TAP-Windows driver shipped with OpenVPN <i>(driver version
9.9 or later)</i>.</p>
