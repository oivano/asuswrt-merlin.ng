This file contains strings from the OpenConnect VPN client, found at
https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/ and browsable in gitweb at
https://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/openconnect.git

We do this because NetworkManager-openconnect authentication dialog
uses a lot of strings from libopenconnect, which also need to be
translated too if the user is to have a fully localised experience.

For translators looking to see source comments in their original context
in order to translate them properly, the URLs by each one will give a
link to the original source code.
