<h1>Install a <tt>vpnc-script</tt>.</h1>

<p>OpenConnect just handles the communication with the VPN server; it does
not know how to configure the network routing and name service (DNS) on all the
various operating systems that it runs on.</p>

<p>To set the routing and name service up, it uses an external script
which is usually called <tt>vpnc-script</tt>. It was originally identical to
the same script that
<a href="https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/">vpnc</a>
used; vpnc is a client for IKEv1-based VPNs (including Cisco VPN Concentrator)
but has not been officially updated since 2008. OpenConnect has evolved
and improved this script in mostly-backwards compatible ways, adding updated
support for more platforms, completing IPv6 support, and fixing bugs.</p>

<p>If <tt>vpnc-script</tt> was not included with your distribution of OpenConnect,
you can get a current version from
<a href="https://gitlab.com/openconnect/vpnc-scripts/raw/master/vpnc-script">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Note that the script needs to be executable, and stored somewhere
where SELinux or similar security systems won't prevent the root user
from accessing it.</p>

<p>Modern versions of OpenConnect are configured
with the location of the script at build time, and will use that script
automatically. If you are using a packaged build of OpenConnect rather than
building it yourself, then the OpenConnect package should have a dependency
on a suitable version of <tt>vpnc-script</tt> and should be built to look in
the right place for it. Hopefully your distribution gets that right.
If OpenConnect is invoked without a suitable script, it will not be able
to configure the routing or name service for the VPN.</p>

<h1>Alternatives</h1>

<p>If you want to use
a script other than the one that OpenConnect was configured to use, you
can use the <tt>--script</tt> argument on the command line. For example:
 <ul><li><tt>openconnect --script /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script https://vpn.example.com/</tt></li></ul></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dlenski/vpn-slice">vpn-slice</a>
script (written in Python, by one of the OpenConnect developers) is a
replacement for OpenConnect's bundled vpnc-script, with a specific focus
on making it simple to connect to a VPN with OpenConnect, while
customizing routing so that only a limited subset of traffic flows
through the VPN. (Sometimes known as a "split tunnel.")</p>

<h1>Windows</h1>

<p>On Windows, the default configuration of OpenConnect will look for
a script named <tt>vpnc-script-win.js</tt> in the same directory as the
<tt>openconnect.exe</tt> executable, and will execute it with the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cscript">command-based
script host (<tt>CScript.exe</tt>)</a>.</p>

<p>The current version of this script can be found <a
href="https://gitlab.com/openconnect/vpnc-scripts/raw/master/vpnc-script-win.js">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that although the script is basically functional for
configuring both IPv6 and Legacy IP, it does not fully tear down the
configuration on exit so stale IP address might be left around on the
interface.</p>
