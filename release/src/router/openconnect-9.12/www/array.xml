<h1>Array Networks AG SSL VPN</h1>

<p>Experimental support for <a
href="https://arraynetworks.com/products-secure-access-gateways-ag-series.html">Array
AG SSL VPN</a> was added to OpenConnect in May 2021 for the 9.00 release. It is used for access to
<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iaas-vpn?topic=iaas-vpn-vpn-ssl-faq">IBM Cloud</a>
private networks.</p>

<p>Array mode is requested by adding <tt>--protocol=array</tt>
to the command line:
<pre>
  openconnect --protocol=array vpn.lon.softlayer.com
</pre></p>

<h2>Quirks and Issues</h2>

<p>Currently, OpenConnect only supports basic username/password
authentication. If you have access to an Array VPN which uses other
types of authentication (e.g.  RSA or OATH tokens), please send
information to <a href="mail.html">the mailing list</a> so that we add
support to OpenConnect.</p>

<p>Connectivity over DTLS is supported, but currently limited to DTLSv1.0
because no known version of the server supports DTLSv1.2. Some operating
systems might ban DTLSv1.0 in their default security settings.</p>
