# topic[/subtopic]: Short description which should finish before char 72
#
# [Optional general description of the changeset goes here. See below for
#  further guidance.  A short description of each specific change
#  made:]
#
# * <file>: (function/typemacro) type of change
# * <file>: (func_{a,b,c}) Frobnicated to match the foo.
# * <file>: (foo_{bar,war}) Ditto.
# * <file>: (fnar_*) Ditto, and also twiddled for the thing.

# Guidelines:
#
# - Set your editor to 72 char line width (so 'git log' fits in 80
#   chars).
#
# The 'topic' is used to collate the commit logs, to create summaries
# for release announcements, so please provide one. 
#
# Often the topic is the name of the daemon affected (e.g.  'bgpd' or
# 'ospfd'), or 'lib', or 'build'.  The subtopic isn't often used, but
# 'security' is a good one to provide on security fixes.
#
# The body should provide:
#
#     -  The motivation for the change (does it fix a bug, if so which? 
#        add a feature?)
#
#    -   The general approach taken, and trade-offs versus any other
#        approaches.
#
#    -   Any testing undertaken or other information affecting the
#        confidence that can be had in the change.
#
#    -   Information to allow reviewers to be able to tell which
#        specific changes to the code are intended (and hence be able
#        to spot any accidental unintended changes).
#
# -   The commit message *must* give details of all the authors of the change,
#     beyond the person listed in the Author field.  Any and all
#     affiliations which may have a bearing on copyright in any way
#     should be clearly stated, unless those affiliations are already
#     obvious from other details, e.g.  from the email address.  This
#     would cover employment and contracting obligations (give
#     details).
#
#     Note: Do not rely on "Signed-off-by" for this, be explicit.
#    
# -   If the change introduces a new dependency on any code or other
#     copyrighted material, please explicitly note this.  Give details
#     of what that external material is, the copyright licence the
#     material may be used under, and the nature of the dependency.
#
# Please have a look at the git commit logs to get a feel for what the
# norms are.
