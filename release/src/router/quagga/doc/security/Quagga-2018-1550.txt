Quagga Security Note 2018-1550
==============================

https://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1550.txt


Affects:
--------

All versions of Quagga.


Summary
-------

The Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can overrun internal BGP code-to-string
conversion tables used for debug by 1 pointer value, based on input.


Impact
------

The impact is thought to be very low. The bgpd daemon likely will continue
running. Warning and debug messages in the logs may contain arbitrary bytes.

The issue can only be triggered by a configured peer, if there is sufficient
transport security.


Solution
--------

Upgrade to Quagga version 1.2.3, or any version with the fix applied. The
fix is git commit:

  "bgpd/security: debug print of received NOTIFY data can over-read msg array"


Description
------------

The bgpd daemon contains a number of tables to convert BGP code-points to
string representations. These tables are used for logging debug and warning
messages if a NOTIFY is sent.

The lookup into the conversion table used a bound on the size that was 1
greater than the actual size of the table. This allowed the lookup to read 1
pointer past the end of the array, if a lookup was made with an unknown
code-point from a BGP message.
