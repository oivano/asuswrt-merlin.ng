386.13_2-ion (05-May-2024)
  - FIXED:   VPN Status page for IPsec clients and VPN Client IPsec connection status display issue
  - UPDATED: strongswan to 5.9.14

386.13-ion (16-Apr-2024)
  - NOTE: all the models supported by Asuswrt-Merlin on the
          386_xx series are now officialy on Asus' End of Life
          list, which means unless there are new major security
          issues, no new updates will be provided by Asus.

          ion will tentatively attempt to continue to
          provide updates and fixes
  - ADDED:   mtr 0.95
  - ADDED:   openconnect 9.12
  - ADDED:   webui add IPsec client support
  - UPDATED: strongSwan to 5.9.12
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.6.10.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.3.6.
  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.7.16.
  - UPDATED: OUI database used by networkmap and the webui.
  - CHANGED: QOS/Classification page can now resolve local IPv6
             addresses.
  - CHANGED: Display tracked connections on the QoS/Classification
             page even if QoS isn't set to Adaptive QoS.
  - CHANGED: Prevent the use of Apple's iCloud Private Relay
             when enabling "Prevent client auto DoH".
  - CHANGED: NAT Passthrough page - removed the "Enabled + NAT
             Helper" option as the firewall no longer blocks
             traffic when set to disabled.  This is back to the
             former behaviour, where this setting only controls
             whether or not to load the NAT helper.  You might
             need to readjust that setting if you had previously
             changed it.
  - CHANGED: SIP, RTSP and H323 ALG (NAT helpers) are now
             disabled by default, as these legacy features tend
             to create issues with modern VoIP setups.
             This change will only apply to people doing a
             factory default reset of their router.
  - FIXED: CVE-2023-48795 in dropbear.
  - FIXED: Various issues with the QOS Classification page.
  - FIXED: UPNP leases without a description would not appear
           on the Forwarded Ports page.
  - FIXED: web server crashing when entering certain settings on
           the Network Filter Page.  Bypassed bug in closed source
           validation code for now.
  - FIXED: Concurrent cronjob changes through cru could cause
           collisions, leading to missing jobs (dave14305)
  - FIXED: CVE-2023-5678 & CVE-2024-0727 in openssl (backport from
           Ubuntu by RSDNTWK)
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.90 (resolves CVE 2023-50868 and CVE 2023-50387).
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.6.8 (fixes a crash introduced in 2.6.7)
  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1w.
  - UPDATED: curl to 8.4.0.
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.6.7.
  - FIXED: WPS not working on SDK6/SDK7 devices (affecting
           RT-AC68U and RT-AC88U/3100/5300)
  - FIXED: dcd constantly crashing (updated Trend Micro
           components)


386.12-ion (15-Sep-2023)

 - UPDATED: curl to 8.1.2.
 - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.6.
 - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1u.
 - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.7.13.
 - CHANGED: FTP server will now only support strong ciphers
            in TLS mode.
 - FIXED: QOS Classification showing no Upload data on some
          WAN configurations.
 - FIXED: Radio temperature graphs weren't updating
 - FIXED: nvram usage reported on Sysinfo page was inaccurate
          as it included JFFS stored values.
 - UPDATED: curl to 8.0.1.
 - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.6.3.
 - CHANGED: Reduce max OpenVPN clients to 2 for RT-AC68U and
            DSL-AC68U due to lack of NVRAM on these two
            models.  Note that existing settings are not
            automatically removed, you must run the following
            command over SSH to remove them from nvram and
            the /jffs/openvpn/ directory:

               clear_vpnclients.sh

            A backup will be saved in /jffs/openvpn_backup.tgz.

 - FIXED: DDNS was being refreshed every time IPv6 bound6() event
          occured even if IPv6 DDNS update was disabled.
 - FIXED: Wireless Log wouldn't properly show IPv6 address
          for clients with multiple addresses.
 - FIXED: dnsmasq may crash if no DNS server is configured
          (fix backported from dnsmasq upstream)

  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1t.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.3.3.
  - UPDATED: Asus security daemon updated to 2.0 engine (patch
             from Asus)
  - CHANGED: Moved WiFi Radar and Site Survey to the
             Network Tools tab
  - CHANGED: Disabled auto logout on System Log and
             Wireless Log pages.
  - CHANGED: Reduced EDNS packet size from 1280 to 1232
             bytes in dnsmasq, to better work with some
             upstream servers not fully supporting EDNS0.
  - FIXED: NTP redirection wouldn`t work properly with
           Guest Network, removed redirection for these.
  - FIXED: Added missing Tools icon on ROG UI (icon
           contributed by Cody).
  - FIXED: RT-AC68U may crash when using Media Bridge mode
           with a specific SSID length (patch from Asus)


386.9-ion (20-Jan-2023)
 - NOTE: 386_xx release are only for Wifi 5 (802.11ac) models.
 - NEW: Merged with GPL 386_50757.
 - NOTE: 386_xx release are only for Wifi 5 (802.11ac) models.
 - NEW: Merged with GPL 386_50757.

 - UPDATED: getdns/stubby to 1.7.2/0.4.2.
 - UPDATED: zlib to 1.2.12 + backports.
 - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1s.
 - UPDATED: inadyn to 2.10.0.
 - UPDATED: nettle to 3.8.1.
 - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.8.
 - UPDATED: dropbear to 2022.83.
 - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.88.
 - CHANGED: Rebranded DNSFilter as DNS Director.  This will prevent
            confusion with the company sharing the same name, and
            also better describes what the feature does.
 - CHANGED: Setting an OpenVPN client to redirect all traffic while
            in "Exclusive" DNS mode will now force redirect ALL
            DNS traffic just like in VPN Director mode.
            While this will allow redirecting clients with
            hardcoded DNS servers, it also means that your whole
            LAN will lose the ability of doing local name
            resolution.  It might be best to use VPN Director
            in that case to control which client should
            be involved in the DNS redirection, or use
            DNSFilter instead of Exclusive DNS mode.
            editing VPNDirector rules.
 - CHANGED: Switched generated self-signed certificate to an
            EC certificate.
 - CHANGED: Disabled DSS key support in Dropbear SSH.
  - FIXED: Wrong temperatures used by the temperature graphs
           (386.8 regression)
 - FIXED: Guest Network clients couldn't route through VPN
           (regression in 386.4 following a GPL merge).
 - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 aren't
          redirected to the router's NTP if NTP interception is
          enabled.
 - FIXED: Name was truncated to 31 chars when enabling OpenVPN
          client's Server Certificate Name Validation.
 - FIXED: CVE-2022-37434 in zlib.
 - REMOVED: Interface selector on Speedtest page (no longer
            working, possibly due to an ookla client update)
 - NOTE: This release is only available for the RT-AX88U as
          well as the two new models listed below.
  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AXE16000.
  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AX11000_Pro.
  - NEW: Added support for new RT-AX88U hardware revision.
  - UPDATED: Merged with GPL 386_49634.
  - CHANGED: Re-enabled IPv6 DDNS support.
  - CHANGED: Once again block router DNS access over IPv6 when
             using DNSFilter on a pre-HND model (reverted back
             to 386.7 behaviour for that scenario)
  - FIXED: inaccurate nvram usage on Sysinfo page for some HND
           models.  Now accurately report kernel nvram usage.
  - FIXED: WiFi Radar page alignment.
  - FIXED: AiMesh node new firmware popup would use the device model
           (like RT-AC66U_B1) rather than the product id (like
           RT-AC68U) for the generated download URL.
  - FIXED: OVPN client with DNS set to strict had lower priority
           than DNSPrivacy servers.
  - FIXED: IPv6 DNS may be missing if DNSPrivacy is enabled.
  - FIXED: Wifi Radar pages missing on XT12.
  - FIXED: QRcode failing to generate if the SSID contained unicode
           characters (like emojis or other UTF8 entities)

  - NOTE: enabled following quagga services; bgpd, ospfd. Disabled everything else.
  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1n.
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.6.
  - CHANGED: Added Wireguard module + userspace tool to
             GT-AXE11000.
  - FIXED: Only a few DNSFilter clients are supported
           on HND models (entries limited to 255 chars).
  - FIXED: Security issue in AiCloud (backport from Asus)
  - FIXED: Cannot enable Adaptive QoS under certain scenarios
           on pre-HND router models.
  - NEW: Added support for the RT-AC68U V4.  All
         RT-AC68U models are using a combined
         firmware file (like stock firmware),
         with both firmwares within the same file.
  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AXE11000.
  - NEW: Added config option for the Boost key on
         GT models.  The option can be found on the
         Administration -> System page.
  - NEW: Basic IPv6 support for TQoS (Kevin Bracey)
  - UPDATED: Merged with GPL 386_46065.
  - UPDATED: Reverted dnsmasq from 2.86 to 2.85.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.3.0.
  - UPDATED: avahi to 0.8 + a few backports.
  - CHANGED: Improved accuracy of overhead parameters
             in Traditional QoS (Kevin Bracey)
  - CHANGED: Report download stats for TQoS (Kevin Bracey)
  - CHANGED: Report DFS scanning state for both 5 GHz bands

           the OpenVPN server username list if a remote
           client connected over IPv6.
  - FIXED: Earlier syslog content was missing on RT-AX86U
           and RT-AX68U after a reboot.
  - FIXED: WAN monitoring could fail if using IPv6 and
           DNS Rebind protection was enabled.
  - FIXED: RT-AX86U syslog could be truncated after a reboot.

           wouldn't reconfigure the FTP server properly.
  - FIXED: Non-functionning TrendMicro features on the
           RT-AX68U and RT-AX86U (reverted kernel components
           to the previous version).


386.4-ion (14-Jan-2022)

  - NOTE: DSL-AC68U removed support for the following functions; amas bwdpi cfg_sync cloudsync
          conndiag email fileflex gameMode media ookla optimize_xbox pptpd printer repeater
          rrsut snmp timemachine user_low_rssi yadns
          Streamlined RAM usage and cleaned js Web UI pages to show only enabled functions,
          please refer to README.md for Web UI layout of all ion release(s).

386.4 (1-Jan-2022)
  - NEW: Added support for the RT-AX86S (uses the same firmware
         as the RT-AX86U).
  - NEW: Added wireguard kernel module + userspace tool to
         HND models firmware images.
  - NEW: IPv6 support for OpenVPN server.  Allows to remotely
         connect to your router's OpenVPN server over IPv6, and
         reach LAN clients over their IPv6 (redirecting IPv6
         Internet traffic does not work).
  - UPDATED: Merged with GPL 386_45958 + a few newer patches
             from Asus.
  - UPDATED: curl to 7.79.1.
  - UPDATED: vsftpd to 3.0.5.
  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1m.
  - UPDATED: wget to 1.21.1.
  - UPDATED: nettle to 3.7.3.
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.86.
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.5.
  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.5.11.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.2.3-git 20211017.
  - UPDATED: inadyn to 2.9.1.
  - UPDATED: CA bundle to 2021-12-13.
  - UPDATED: amtm to 3.2.2 (thelonelycoder)
  - CHANGED: replaced jitterentropy-rngd with haveged.
             It uses more resources, but it works
             properly on older platforms, and is
             generally less CPU intensive in regular
             use.  This is implemented for all router
             models.
  - CHANGED: Switched dnsmasq crypto backend to nettle.
  - CHANGED: Switched to Asus's own dhcp hostname support.
             Existing dhcp_hostnames entries will be
             converted on first boot.
  - CHANGED: miniupnpd will now be supplied the public WAN
             IP to improve compatibility with dual NAT
             setups.
  - CHANGED: Disabling Auto DoH will now also disable
             Windows' new Discovery of Designated
             Resolvers (DDR) feature.
  - FIXED: Wrong interface might be used for the default
           gateway in an openvpn client routing table.
  - FIXED: Generated OpenVPN certs used SHA1 signatures
           instead of SHA256 (regression from 386.1)
  - FIXED: Various issues with protocol handling when
           importing an ovpn client file.
  - FIXED: IPv6 not working while in Dual WAN mode.
  - FIXED: Failed OpenVPN client connections might sometime
           be stuck with a "Connecting" state.
  - FIXED: NTP sometimes failing to update at boot time
           when using IPv6.
  - FIXED: Changes done by firewall-start may be lost after
           ddns service gets stopped when using tunnelbroker

386.3_2 (6-Aug-2021)
  - NOTE: closed down the Issue tracker on Github, as 90%
          of it was people asking for technical support,
          or failing to use the supplied submission form.
  - NOTE: From now on DSL-AC68U trx images without DSL modem 
          firmware will be provided at each release.
	  Reason: Some ISPs may require older DSL modem fw.
  - CHANGED: Re-disabled jitterentropy-rngd on non-HND
             models.  It kept using CPU time every two
             seconds and had a very marginal impact on
             the entropy pool (which it never could push
             above the target threshold of 1024).
  - CHANGED: Moved the "Redirect Internet traffic" setting on
             the OpenVPN Client page to the Network Settings
             section to increase its visibility, as too many
             users are forgetting to configure it.
  - CHANGED: Display "Internet traffic not redirected" instead
             of "Public IP Unknown" on the OpenVPN Client
             status display when Redirect Internet traffic
             is set to "No".
  - FIXED: Only the first OpenVPN client would be used if
           you had multiple clients connected and the first
           one had a Redirect Internet set to "No".  Now,
           setting this to "No" means that client's routing
           table will no longer get a default gateway
           configured, allowing traffic to be processed
           by other RPDB tables if there wasn't a matching
           route within that client's table.
  - FIXED: IPV6-compatible DNSFilter servers weren't
           properly configured in dnsmasq.
  - FIXED: DNSFilter client rules may get corrupted after a
           reboot.
  - FIXED: Cake QoS for DSL-AX82U now works
  - FIXED: QoS upload classification page now shows upload plot for DSL-AX82U
  - FIXED: WiFi Insight page under wireless tab has been enabled for DSL-AX82U
  - FIXED: DNSFilter has been enabled for DSL-AX82U

386.3 (23-July-2021)
  - NOTE: First time you boot into this version, you need to
          either shift-reload the main index page, or clear
          your browser cache.

  - NEW: Introducing VPN Director, which replaces the original
         policy routing management interface for OpenVPN clients.
         A bit similar to Asus's own VPN Fusion, OpenVPN routing
         rules are now managed through a central web interface,
         and they are stored in JFFS instead of nvram, to allow
         creating more rules, and free up some nvram for
         nvram-limited devices such as the RT-AC68U.
         See the Wiki for more information.

  - NEW: Added QR codes to the networkmap as well as the Guest
         Network page, to allow easily connecting a mobile
         device just by scanning the QR code.
         The generated QR code can also be saved as a file
         if you'd like to print it.

  - CHANGED: Rewrote OpenVPN routing handling.  The firmware will
             now handle route creation itself rather than letting
             the openvpn client create/remove routes.
             The new implementation brings a few changes:

             - "Force Internet traffic through tunnel" can now
               be set to "No", "Yes (All)" or "VPN Director".
             - This setting will now override whatever setting
               pushed by the server regarding gateway redirection.
             - The kill switch can now be used in both "Yes" and
               "VPN Director" routing modes
             - Manually stopping a client will remove the kill
               switch.  It will now only be applied at boot time
               (if client was set to start at boot), or if the
               tunnel is disconnected through a non-user event

  - CHANGED: Reworked OpenVPN's DNS Exclusive mode implementation
             and interaction with dnsmasq.
  - CHANGED: Moved OpenVPN Custom settings content to JFFS, and
             increased max storage length from around 350 chars
             to 4095 chars.
  - CHANGED: Added support for BCM50991 used for the 2.5G
             interface in newer RT-AX86U revisions.
  - UPDATED: nano to 5.7.
  - UPDATED: curl to 7.76.1.
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.85-openssl.
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.3.
  - UPDATED: getdns to 1.7.0.
  - UPDATED: stubby to 0.4.0.
  - FIXED: Setting an OpenVPN client's DNS mode to Exclusive
           could fail to work for certain configurations
  - FIXED: DNS Exclusive redirections applied in Policy mode
           could be executed in the wrong order if you had
           overlapping policy rules in two separate clients.
  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 couldn't be
           routed through an OpenVPN tunnel.
  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 would bypass
           DNSFilter rules.
  - FIXED: USB disks not properly unmounted on reboot
           on some router models.
  - FIXED: Missing error report on OpenVPN client connection
           failure
  - FIXED: profile.add getting used even if JFFS scripting
           was disabled (dave14305)
  - FIXED: Freedns authentication errors would not
           properly be reported as errors.


386.2_6 (6-June-2021)
  - NOTE: The IRC channel, #asuswrt, has moved to the
          Libera IRC network (https://libera.chat/).

  - UPDATED: chart.js to 2.9.4.
  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.5.8.
  - UPDATED: root certificate bundle to June 5th 2021.
  - FIXED: Fragattack security issues
  - FIXED: DSL-AX82U: CPU frequency is now visible in tools page
  - FIXED: DSL-AX82U: Kernel supports cake QoS
  - NEW: DSL-AX82U: Added IFTT support

386.2_4 (30-Apr-2021)
  - NEW: Added jitterentropy-rngd to non-HND models, in addition
         to HND models.
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.5.2.
  - UPDATED: jitterentropy-rngd to 1.2.2 (library 3.0.3)
  - FIXED: Scheduled new FW checks wouldn't display the webui
           notification icon when the local router had a
           new release available.
  - FIXED: OpenVPN server would flip into an error state (being
           shown as "initializing" on the webui) whenever an
           inbound client failed to connect to it.
  - FIXED: DSL-AX82U: CPU frequency is now visible in tools page

386.2_2 (13-Apr-2021)
  - FIXED: IPv6 pings were blocked if sent below the rate limit
           instead of above (issue introduced in 42095)
  - FIXED: kernel debuging log entry (was removed) (RT-AC86U)
  - FIXED: Field that accepted a float value would reject
           values equal to the allowed minimum (for example
           the QoS bandwidth limits)
  - FIXED: QoS Bandwidth settings were hidden on
           non-HND models when accessing the QoS page.
  - CHANGED: Tweaks to the Firmware Upgrade page display.
  - CHANGED: Enabling DOS protection will now also rate limit
             ICMPV6 echo (type 128) packets, like with IPv4.


386.2 (2-Apr-2021)
  - NOTE: due to changes in how custom device icons are handled,
          first time you boot with 386.2 you need to either
          shift-reload the main index page, or clear your
          browser cache.

  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AX11000.  Note that VPN Fusion,
         as well as the ROG-specific features such as the custom
         UI are not supported.
  - NEW: Added support for the RT-AX68U.
  - NEW: Added jitterentropy-rngd daemon to HND routers.  This will
         ensure sufficient entropy is generated early on at
         boot time, reducing boot stalls caused by insufficient
         entropy for the kernel's random number generator,
         and also generally improves security related to
         crypto operations by the router.
  - NEW: Added Cake QoS for HND routers.  Note that just like
         Traditional QoS, this is not compatible with hardware
         acceleration, and therefore might not be usable on
         connections faster than around 350 Mbps (may vary based
         on router models).
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 386_42095.
  - UPDATED: Openssl to 1.1.1k.
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.5.1.
  - UPDATED: iproute2 to 5.11.0 (HND models).
  - UPDATED: root certificate bundle to March 9th 2021.
  - CHANGED: qos-start "init" user script now runs in blocking
             mode to ensure it's able to complete any changes
             it may apply to qos configs before these
             configs get applied.
  - FIXED: Router could get stuck at boot time after the user
           migrated from stock firmware, or just erased his
           JFFS partition, requiring a factory default reset.
  - FIXED: ATM checkbox could not be enabled on QOS page.
  - FIXED: DST not getting applied to some timezones (snauton)
  - FIXED: Traditional QoS was broken in 386.1 (dave14305)
  - FIXED: Connected IPSEC clients weren't shown on the VPN Status
           page.
  - FIXED: Userspace conntrack tool was no longer working
  - FIXED: Traffic Monitor spikes for HND models.  (Asus backport)
  - FIXED: webui incorrectly complaining about mismatched timezone
           between browser and webui for some timezones (dave14305)
  - REMOVED: SSH Brute Force Protection option (already handled
             by Asuswrt's protect service daemon)


386.1_2 (12-Feb-2021)
  - NEW: Added snmp support to the RT-AX86U.
  - UPDATED: inadyn to 2.8.1.
  - UPDATED: nano to 5.5.
  - CHANGED: Use local OUI database instead of remote one hosted
             on Asus's server (allows queries to work even when
             accessing webui over https)
  - CHANGED: If dropbear cannot create keys in /jffs then
             create temporary ones in /etc so SSH can work even
             without a working JFFS partition.
  - FIXED: Missing Game Mode on RT-AC88U
  - FIXED: Non-working 160 MHz settings for RT-AC88U region/versions
           that should support it
  - FIXED: Missing Instant Guard to RT-AX56U and RT-AC88U.
  - FIXED: IPv6 ending with "::" were considered invalid on the
           webui (was breaking the Prefix field on the 6in4 tunnel
           page for instance).
  - FIXED: OUI lookups on site survey page not working
           (for non-HND models)
  - FIXED: Wifi Radar missing on GT-AC2900
  - FIXED: Netools-enabled pages not used by GT-AC2900 and
           RT-AX86U
  - FIXED: GeForce NOW UPNP not working
  - FIXED: Erasing the JFFS partition would often require a second
           reboot since the operation failed when encountering
           a bad block.  These are now properly skipped.
  - FIXED: Parental Control's time scheduler not working properly.


386.1 (30-Jan-2021)
  Switched to the new 386 codebase.  386 introduces
  AiMesh 2.0, finalizes the move to OpenSSL 1.1.1
  firmware-wide, adds a new speedtest (powered
  by Ookla).  For more details, please refer
  to Asus's own release notes.

  - NOTE: For developers, note that firmware code is
          once again back on the master branch, with
          both mainline and ax being reunified again.

  - NOTE: Some users upgrading might have to go through some
          database maintenance on first boot, which means the
          router might be slower or have a non-responsive webui
          for a while.
          This can take anywhere from 5 minutes up to an hour,
          depending on your model, just give it time to complete
          the process.

  - NEW: Added support for the RT-AX86U.
  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AC2900, with a few restrictions:
           - Non-ROG UI is used
           - VPN Fusion is not supported
           - A few other ROG-specific features are not supported
         This is an experiment done in collaboration with Asus.
  - NEW: Added support for the RT-AC68U V3.
  - NEW: Added stub and stub-v2 compression options to OpenVPN
         clients.  Not added to server, since compression is
         considered deprecated, and will be removed most likely
         in OpenVPN 2.6, for security reasons.
  - NEW: Added tls-crypt-v2 support to OpenVPN clients.
  - NEW: Added option to select an OpenVPN client when
         running Oookla Speedtest.
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 386_41700
  - UPDATED: Openssl to 1.1.1i.
  - UPDATED: Updated to OpenVPN 2.5.0.  Note that OpenVPN
             2.4.0 or newer is now required by the exported
             client config file.  You can still manually
             configure an older client to connect with your
             router.
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.84, resolving CVE-2020-25681,
             CVE-2020-25682, CVE-2020-25683, CVE-2020-25687,
             CVE-2020-25684, CVE-2020-25685 and
             CVE-2020-25686 aka DNSpooq  (themiron)
  - UPDATED: nano to 5.2.
  - UPDATED: curl to 7.72.0.
  - UPDATED: zlib to 1.2.11.
  - UPDATED: lz4 to 1.9.2.
  - UPDATED: e2fsprogs to 1.45.6.
  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2020.81.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.2 (git snapshot from 20201129)
  - UPDATED: Switched userspace ipset from 6.32 to 7.6 (to match
             with upstream)
  - CHANGED: firmware update checks are no longer using the
             server address stored in nvram, for security
             reasons.  Devs who were using that nvram
             should instead edit the webs_scripts/* to
             use their own URL.
  - CHANGED: The old legacy cipher setting in OpenVPN is now only
             available when running with static key authentication.
  - CHANGED: Tweaks to the OpenVPN webui layout
  - CHANGED: OpenVPN clients will now NAT all outbound traffic,
             regardless of the source subnet.
  - CHANGED: Reworked the display of DNSPrivacy presets
  - CHANGED: Added AdGuard (ad blocking) and CIRA Canadian Shield
             (non US-based service) to the DNSPrivacy presets.
  - CHANGED: At boot time, OpenVPN killswitch will only be
             applied for clients set to auto-start with WAN.
  - CHANGED: Increased number of available mount points for addon
             webpages to 20.
  - CHANGED: Multiple routes can now be defined per client on the
             OpenVPN client-specific configuration.
  - CHANGED: Improved NAT acceleration report for newer models on
             the sysinfo page.  Now query the hardware for the
             current state instead of reporting the nvram values.
  - CHANGED: When logging allowed connections is enabled, also log
             outbound LAN connections (reverts to the behaviour from
             a few years ago)
  - FIXED: DHCP could fail to renew its lease with some ISPs when
           Trend Micro engine was enabled (workaround provided
           by Asus)
  - FIXED: OpenVPN client remote IP wasn't updated on client
           stop/restart.
  - FIXED: Couldn't force generating a new SSL certificate for the
           webui.
  - REMOVED: Option to disable NCP.  The NCP cipher list is
             now used both for NCP and non-NCP endpoints.
  - REMOVED: fq_codel support for Adaptive QoS.  Due to a change
             in how Trend Micro configures QoS, it is no longer
             possible to intercept these to inject fq_codel.
  - REMOVED: Option to select sfq as a queue scheduler for t.QoS
             or Bandwidth Limiter, and always use fq_codel.
  - REMOVED: Support for the Cloudcheck mobile app.
